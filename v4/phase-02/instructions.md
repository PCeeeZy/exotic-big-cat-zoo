Now lets setup a basic server that serves static html.  Don't worry about API routes yet.

The html page should have an area for signup, an area for login, and an area for content but does not need any styling or functionality yet--just wireframe.

Also don't forget to create a package.json and get your entry point and dependencies setup correctly.

Your file and folder structure should look something like this
```
db/
    shema, queries, seed . sql from last phase
public/
    css/
        style.css
    js/
        script.js

    index.html
routes/
    index.js

server.js
package.json

```
